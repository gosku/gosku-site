Hello! I have a blog... again.

Twenty years ago, I decided to start a _Wordpress_ site called *[NoSéQué.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20191029162157/http://www.noseque.net/)*. This was during the early days of the _blogosphere_, a trend that would eventually be eclipsed by social media but was quite popular for a few years.

During its effervescence, authors could create a blog using platforms like _Blogger_ or self-host sites with custom domain names. Once live, they could publish content and share their ideas. While this might seem commonplace today, it was revolutionary back then. The internet was transitioning from a one-way medium to a two-way platform where users could both consume and create content.

I was part of this movement and spent several happy years contributing to the blogosphere. Until I abandoned it in 2015, my blog was a tool for learning many things:

- I gained hands-on experience with HTML, templates, CSS, web servers, and domain names, which introduced me to the world of web development.
- I experimented with SEO and web positioning, gaining insights into how businesses generate revenue online.
- Most importantly, I improved my writing skills, learning to structure ideas, organize thoughts, and effectively communicate them in written form.

### Why I abandoned my blog

While it was a fun and rewarding experience, it wasn't without its challenges. 


In the final years of my blogging journey, as the hype faded and I lost interest in SEO, I shifted my focus to writing in-depth articles and creating quality content. I like to think some of those articles were interesting, but they took a lot of my time.

Another aspect of publishing on the internet that began to affect me was dealing with trolls. I tried to ignore the hurtful comments, but I often found myself responding and falling into the trap. In fact, these negative experiences with trolls impacted my relationship with social media to the point that I now barely contribute to social networks, or at least not in public channels.

The third (and likely most significant) reason I abandoned my blog was the tools I was using. I wasn’t skilled enough to create a design that I found satisfying, and I discovered that I really dislike CSS. Additionally, I didn’t like the direction WordPress was heading, the tools it offered, or its ecosystem in general. I especially disliked having to log into a portal to write a document in a WYSIWYG editor. For a while, I remember being able to write my articles from TextMate using a blogging bundle, a kind of plugin that used a Wordpress API to publish the content, but that changed when I switched to Linux. Finally, although PHP was my first language for web servers, I found its syntax uncomfortable to work with.


This last aspect is often overlooked, but it can significantly impact how you feel about any hobby or profession. *The tools you use should be enjoyable to work with*; they should inspire you and make the process pleasant. In the development world, a prime example of this idea relates to text editors or IDEs: if you dislike your editor, you’re likely to become a frustrated and unhappy programmer.

### Why I'm creating a new blog

A lot has changed in my life since I stopped writing on my previous site. Personally, I moved to a different country and became the father of two daughters. Professionally, I started as a Python developer and eventually became an Engineering Lead.

But it's not just me who changed. Society has evolved too. Some aspects for the better, but others in ways that are clearly harmful to all of us.
With the rise of social media and the relentless drive to optimize profits within these platforms, the relationship between internet users and media has been intentionally and drastically reshaped. It has turned into an environment dominated by fast-paced platforms where users consume disposable, bite-sized pieces of information: teenagers watching videos at 2x speed, platforms promoting one-minute videos, and Twitter becoming a primary channel for consuming written content. The shorter the content, the more users consume it (and the more content companies can monetize). But beyond the economic implications, this shift has affected user expectations: users are not able to read longer, reflective articles anymore (not to mention books), they don't have enough patience to do it. I count myself among them.

Somehow, I feel compelled to push back against this trend, not just for myself, but  for those around me. It may sound extreme, but in today's increasingly dystopian reality, reading a long book in front of your children could almost be seen as an act of rebellion. And so is writing. 

Slow writing, or *writing as a medium for reflection and organizing ideas*, is the primary intention of this new blog. Often, the final content published here won’t really matter, even if it might occasionally prove useful to others. What truly matters is the hidden process (the journey) that leads to the final version of an article. Telling readers that the most important part of a blog lies beyond what they see may sound unappealing, but I believe honesty is more important.

There is a second challenge I'm trying to address in this new journey: This will be the first time I will be publishing content in English, a language that I have spoken for long time now but that is not my native language. Fighting against the constant feeling of vulnerability when communicating in a second language is an extra motivation to me.

In creating this new space, I hope to reclaim the joy of thoughtful writing and reading, endangered activities in today’s fast-paced digital world. This space will be an experiment in slowing down, reflecting, and embracing vulnerability. My goal won't be around whether these articles resonate with others or simply serve as a personal exercise in growth, but the act of writing with intention as a meaningful exercise against a culture of brevity and distraction.
