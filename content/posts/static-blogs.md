Today I Learnt (TIL) that you can make blogging a simple relationship between you and your text editor. No more navigating through admin portals and writting in _WYSIWYG_ forms. Just your text editor (your favorite interface) and you. I'm just discovering [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which seems to be markdown based, file based and simple enough to be git versioned.

```python
import datetime

datetime.datetime.now()
```
